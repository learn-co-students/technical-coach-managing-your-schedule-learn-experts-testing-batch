# Managing Your Schedule

Schedule and availability management is done through [WhenIWork](https://app.wheniwork.com).

## Setting Your Availability

You can set your availability preferences through WhenIWork. Click on your profile icon at the top right of the page, then click `My Availability` from the dropdown options. From here, you can set your preferences for when you would like to work, when you would prefer not to work, and when you're unavailable.

When you click on a particular date in the WhenIWork calendar, you can specify a block of time, and a preference - either `I'M UNAVAILABLE TO WORK` or `I PREFER TO WORK`. Any blocks of time that are not marked off as one of these two options are generally understood to be times when you are available, but would prefer not to work. **You may ultimately be scheduled during those times.**

In addition to the preferences listed in WhenIWork, there is also a Google doc that Erika sends out once a month (generally the second Monday of the month) for shift preferences, **if** there are enough TCs on staff to allow some flexibility. Think of this as your "wish list" for the next month - Erika will try to accommodate you if possible, but ultimately the availabilities given in WhenIWork will take precedence.

In this document, you are allowed to choose your preferred shifts each week (six shifts in total). For example, you might like a 2-7 shift Monday through Thursday and a 9-1 on Saturday mornings. **You cannot fill in slots that have been taken already**. When you are finished filling in your preferences, you'll fill in an `X` next to your name at the top of the Google doc. This that is based on your availability - TCs that have more availability in WhenIWork are given access to the document before TCs with less availability have access to it. Outside of that, it is a first-come, first-served system. 

Your Faculty Manager will do their best to accommodate your preferences, but you may not get all the shifts or times you've requested, or you may get more. In that case, feel free to swap, drop, or add a shift in WhenIWork.

## Swapping a Shift

* Log into WhenIWork
* Click on your profile icon and go to to `My Schedule`
* Click on the shift you'd like to swap, then select `Swap Shift`
* Select the shifts you'd like to trade, add a message, then click `Initiate Swap`. This will message anyone on those shifts with a request to trade shifts.

If you want better or more immediate visibility on the swap request, send an email to [osbtechcoaches@flatironschool.com](mailto:osbtechcoaches@flatironschool.com) letting everyone know that you're looking to swap the shift. If you're looking for a swap, and a reply comes in, make sure to reply-all and let everyone know if that exchange works or does not work for you (so people know if they should keep going after this shift). Another option would be to  `@here` the `#online-tc-channel` for more urgent requests, but again, be sure to reply to any responses.

Make sure you confirm the swap on WhenIWork!

*Note: Until a shift is successfully swapped, you are still responsible for it.*

## Dropping a Shift

Dropping a shift is very similar to swapping a shift.

* Log into WhenIWork
* Click on your profile icon and go to `My Schedule`
* Click on the shift you'd like to swap, then select `Drop Shift`
* Select the users you'd like to offer the shift to, add a message, then click `Initiate Drop`. This will message anyone on those shifts with a request to pick up the shift.

For better or more immediate visibility on the drop request, send an email to [osbtechcoaches@flatironschool.com](mailto:osbtechcoaches@flatironschool.com) and follow the instructions as listed for swapping a shift.

*Note: Until a shift is successfully dropped, you are still responsible for it.*

## Picking Up an Open Shift

Available open shifts will appear at the bottom of your schedule, beneath the calendar. To pick up an open shift, click on one, then follow the instructions, then confirm the shift has been added to your schedule.

**Note: For any scheduling issues that can't be resolved through WhenIWork, please contact your Erika, your Faculty Manager, via Slack or at: [erika.hughes@flatironschool.com ](mailto:erika.hughes@flatironschool.com ).**
